# billtracker_grunt

Ok, I just pulled this down and got it working so we should be good.

This whole folder is a mac virtual environment (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Steps to get this working (only tested on mac so far):

* If you don't have node installed, do that https://nodejs.org/en/download/

* Update npm https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

* Install Grunt if it's not already by typing `npm install -g grunt-cli`

1. git clone https://github.com/bill-tracker/billtracker_grunt.git

2. cd billtracker_grunt

3. source bin/activate

4. npm install

5. pip install -r requirements.txt

6. grunt devserver
